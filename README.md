# Speech-Feature-Extraction-and-Analysis-for-Speaker-profiling
Analyze voice features like MFCC, pitch &amp; energy to profile speakers from audio signals using Python

This project extracts important speech features from audio files like:

- MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients)
- Pitch (Voice frequency)
- Energy (Loudness)
- Duration (Length of audio)

These features help in understanding speaker characteristics for tasks like speaker identification or voice-based analysis.

Folder Structure

- `audio/` – Contains input `.wav` audio files  
- `plots/` – Stores the generated graphs (MFCC, pitch, etc.)  
- `speaker_profiling.py` – Extracts features from audio  
- `eda_visualization.py` – Plots and visualizes extracted data  
- `output.csv` – CSV file with extracted features  
- `requirements.txt` – Required Python libraries  
- `README.md` – Project description  
- `.gitignore` – Files to ignore in GitHub

Features Extracted:

MFCC – Helps understand how the voice sounds
Pitch – High or low tone of the voice
Energy – Volume or strength of the sound
Duration – How long the speech lasts

Tools Used:

Python
Librosa
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
