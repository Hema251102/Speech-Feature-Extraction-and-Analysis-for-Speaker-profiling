# Speech Feature Extraction and Analysis for Speaker Profiling

This project extracts basic speech features (pitch, MFCCs, energy, duration) from recorded `.wav` files for speaker profiling using Python and Librosa.

##  Folder Structure
- `audio/`: Recorded voice samples
- `speaker_profiling.py`: Main script to extract features
- `output.csv`: CSV containing extracted voice features
- `eda_visualization.ipynb`: Optional notebook for plotting graphs

## Features Extracted:
- Duration
- Mean Pitch (Hz)
- Energy (RMS)
- First 5 MFCCs
- Spectral features (ZCR, Centroid, Bandwidth)

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Librosa
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SpeechRecognition
